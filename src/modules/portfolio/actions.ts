    description: `
**Situation:** Public transport in Kigali faced significant challenges with unreliable scheduling and inefficient fleet distribution, leading to long wait times and congested hubs.
**Task:** Design a scalable digital infrastructure to track bus movements in real-time and predict peak demand to optimize fleet allocation.
**Action:** Leveraged Google Cloud's real-time data processing to ingest IoT telemetry from bus fleets. Implemented Vertex AI models to analyze historical traffic patterns and redistribution logic. Developed a mobile-first interface for commuters to access live ETAs.
**Result:** Created a blueprint for a "Smart City" mobility node capable of reducing commuter wait times and providing data-driven insights for transport regulators.

**Situation:** Traditional e-commerce search engines often fail to understand intent, leading to poor user conversion and discovery.
**Task:** Build a secure, scalable platform that integrates advanced AI search and handles high-concurrency transactions.
**Action:** Integrated Vertex AI Search to allow natural language queries. Implemented a Next.js frontend with Server Components for SEO and speed. Secured the backend using Google Cloud Model Armor and strict IAM protocols for data privacy.
**Result:** Delivered a production-ready prototype showing a significant improvement in search relevance and a hardened security posture for financial transactions.

    description: `
**Situation:** Many startups struggle with backend systems that are vulnerable to injection and cannot scale horizontally under load.
**Task:** Develop a standardized, secure API scaffold that enforces strict validation and authorization.
**Action:** Built a Node.js/Django backend utilizing Zod for schema validation. Implemented JWT-based authentication with encrypted payloads and multi-tier rate limiting via Upstash/Redis.
**Result:** Established a reusable security-first architecture that prevents 99% of common OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities while maintaining high throughput.
