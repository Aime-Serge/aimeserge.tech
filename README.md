# Aime Serge Portfolio Platform

A production-style portfolio, research, and professional branding platform built with `Next.js 15`, `React 19`, `TypeScript`, `Supabase`, and `OpenAI` integrations.

## Key Routes

### Public

- `/`
- `/projects`
- `/projects/[slug]`
- `/research`
- `/research/[slug]`
- `/blog`
- `/blog/[id]`
- `/resume`
- `/contact`
- `/terminal`

### Admin

- `/admin`

### API

- `/api/v1/ai/chat`
- `/api/v1/ai/voice/tts`
- `/api/v1/ai/voice/stt`
- `/api/v1/search`

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with the following values:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
JWT_SECRET=
ADMIN_EMAIL=
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Variable Notes

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Public client key for browser access
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Required for privileged server operations
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret used for admin session verification
- `ADMIN_EMAIL`: Email used for admin checks and internal logging

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Add the required values to `.env.local`.

### 3. Set up Supabase

Use the SQL definitions in:

- `SEED_SQL.md`
- `supabase/migrations/20240421_security_and_newsletter.sql`

Make sure your project includes:

- `projects`
- `broadcasts`
- `research`
- `certificates`
- `contacts`
- `knowledge`
- `security_logs`

Also ensure:

- `pgvector` extension is enabled
- storage buckets such as `artifacts` and `resumes` exist if you use uploads
- Row Level Security and policies are configured appropriately for production

### 4. Run the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run start
npm run lint
```

Additional helper scripts:

```bash
node scripts/setup-admin.mjs
node scripts/seed-research.mjs
node scripts/sync-kb.mjs
```

## Search and AI Architecture

The platform supports two layers of intelligent discovery:

### Global Search

- Aggregates projects, research, and broadcasts
- Builds searchable documents with cached indexing
- Scores documents by title, snippet, tags, and full searchable text

### RAG Assistant

- Embeds content into a Supabase `knowledge` table
- Retrieves semantically relevant chunks via `match_knowledge`
- Injects retrieved context into the AI system prompt
- Streams responses through the AI route handler

## Security Design

Security is a first-class concern in this project.

- Middleware injects CSP and additional security headers
- Admin routes require a verified JWT cookie
- Public interactions are rate limited
- Sensitive workflows use a server action shield wrapper
- Audit logs are written to `security_logs`
- Optional PII redaction is available before processing inputs

## Storage and Media

The project supports:

- public resume delivery
- certificate PDF links
- research paper PDFs
- case study documents
- image and media asset resolution through Supabase Storage helpers

## Deployment

This project is designed to work well with `Vercel` and `Supabase`.

Recommended production setup:

- Deploy the Next.js app to Vercel
- Host database and storage in Supabase
- Configure environment variables in Vercel
- Apply SQL schema and migrations in Supabase
- Use secure secrets for `JWT_SECRET` and service-role access

## Ideal Use Cases

- Technical personal brand platform
- Engineering portfolio with dynamic content management
- Research publishing hub
- AI-enhanced professional profile
- Secure showcase for projects, certifications, and downloadable artifacts

## Roadmap Ideas

- richer admin analytics
- automated content ingestion for new artifacts
- improved semantic ranking for search
- multi-user admin roles
- voice-native AI assistant workflows
- stronger observability and monitoring
